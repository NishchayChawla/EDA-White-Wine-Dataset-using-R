# EDA-White-Wine-Dataset-using-R

## Overview:
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyse data sets for summarizing their main characteristics and general trends, with visual and summary statistics methods.
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis of a tidy data set having 4,898 white wines(observations) with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
The project includes Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis of the data mainly using ggplot package

This data set is provided by Udacity using the following research article:
Cortez, P.; Cerdeira, A.; Almeida, F.; Matos, T.; Reis, J. Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. Decision Support Systems. 2009, 47, 547-553.
